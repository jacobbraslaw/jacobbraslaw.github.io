# Hi, I'm Jacob Braslaw.
</center>


  I am a engineering student at College of San Mateo. My interests are in large scale environmental action and increased efficiency of resource consumption. I have a background in data science and spatial analysis and am seeking to bridge the gap between traditional engineering and data analytics. 
  
  Currently I work as a staff data scientist for ERM (Environmental Resources Management). I specialize in  using R for statistical and spatial analyses. We typically conduct the numerical analysis for our project teams at and present the analysis in visually appealing manner for our clients. We leverage the use of shiny, Rmarkdown, and python dash to produce user friendly outputs that allow for efficiently interpreting the results. 
  

If you are interested in contacting me, you can reach out at <jacobbraslaw@ucsb.edu>

If you would like to discuss data analytics please navigate to PlzAnalytics consulting.

  When I am not in the library working, I am often seen in rec sports leagues exploring the outdoors with friends!

### *Where I'm From*

I grew up in Pacifica, CA, a small coastal town 20 miles south of San Francisco. I went to [Terra Nova High 
School](https://www.juhsd.net/tnhs) then attended [College of San Mateo](https://smccd.edu/) where I completed my general education with a biology focus and participated in intercollegiate baseball. In 2018 I transferred to [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) and plan to graduate in December 2020.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(rmapshaper)

places <- USAboundaries::us_cities() %>% 
  filter(city %in% c("Pacifica", "Santa Barbara", "San Mateo")) %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  st_transform(4326)

city<- c("Santa Barbara", "Pacifica","San Mateo")
feature<- c( "UC Santa Barbara","Hometown", "College of San Mateo")

travels<- data.frame(city,feature)
places<-full_join(places,travels, by = "city")



leaflet(width= "100%") %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri)%>% addMarkers(data = places, label = ~city, popup = ~feature)
```
